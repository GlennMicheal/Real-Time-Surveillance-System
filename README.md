This implementation covers the following objectives for a Real-Time Surveillance System:

Increased Threat Detection: Real-time object detection (YOLO) and motion detection algorithms (Background Subtraction).
Real-Time Response: Immediate alerting through email notifications when suspicious activities are detected.
Improved Crime Prevention: Motion detection and proactive tracking of suspicious behavior to prevent crimes.
Enhanced Security Coverage: Multiple camera support for broader surveillance coverage.
Efficient Resource Allocation: Using KMeans clustering for categorizing surveillance zones to optimize resources.
These are the foundational code snippets that can be integrated into a larger system with additional functionalities, such as a central monitoring dashboard, cloud-based storage for video footage, and more advanced AI-based analytics for further optimizing threat detection and response.
